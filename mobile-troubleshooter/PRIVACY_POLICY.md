We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Collection of Your Information

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application includes:

### Personal Data

Personally identifiable information, such as your name and email address, that you voluntarily give to us when you register with the Application using Google Sign-In. This information is used to create and manage your account.

### Derivative Data

Information our servers automatically collect when you access the Application, such as your mobile device's ID, model, and manufacturer, operating system, version information, and IP address. This is collected via Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to improve our service.

### Financial Data

We do not directly collect or store any financial information. All financial information related to in-app purchases is processed by the respective platform's payment gateway (Google Play Store or Apple App Store). We only receive a transaction receipt, which we validate on our server to confirm your subscription status.

## 3. Use of Your Information

Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Application to:

- Create and manage your account.

## 4. AI Chat and Screenshot Data

Our Application includes an AI-powered chat assistant. When you use this feature, you may choose to provide additional context by uploading a screenshot.

- **Explicit Consent:** We will **always** ask for your explicit consent before uploading your screenshot. You will be presented with a clear dialog explaining that the image will be sent to a third-party AI provider for analysis.
- **Purpose of Use:** The screenshot is used solely for the purpose of providing you with troubleshooting assistance. It is sent to our backend, which then forwards it to a third-party AI service (e.g., Google Gemini or OpenAI).
- **Data Minimization and Anonymization:** We do not store your screenshots on our servers after they have been processed by the AI provider. We make a reasonable effort to remove any obvious personal information from the image metadata before it is sent.
- **Third-Party AI Providers:** Your screenshot data is subject to the privacy policies of the AI provider we use. We are committed to using reputable providers with strong privacy and security standards.

## 5. GDPR Consent for Ads

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), we will display a GDPR consent form before showing any personalized advertisements. This allows you to choose whether you want to see ads that are tailored to your interests. You can change your consent choice at any time within the app's settings.

## 6. Disclosure of Your Information

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties except in the following situations:

- **By Law or to Protect Rights:** If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others.
- **Third-Party Service Providers:** We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including data analysis (Firebase Analytics), error logging (Firebase Crashlytics), and AI processing.

## 7. Security of Your Information

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
